While it is crucial for everyone to take self quarantine seriously amidst the corona virus pandemic, it is also important that a state of panic is avoided. Medical services around the globe are working hard and their efforts are evident as the number of recovered cases increase at decent rate everyday. 

The dashboard is designed  to show the full picture of the situation with emphasis on the recovered cases to underscore the efforts of doctors around the globe. I would like to thank John Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE) for collating data from multiple sources and publishing it on a daily basis for educational use.
